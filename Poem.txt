Now We Are Six and the story

When I was One,
I had just begun.
When I was Two,
I was nearly new.
When I was Three
I was hardly me.
When I was Four,
I was not much more.
Life Story
When I was Five,
I was just alive.
But now I am Six,
living the life
from now on, I'm as clever as clever,
So I think I'll be six now for ever and ever.
